Capsicum unresolved issues:
 - we use simple fork(), but we should use fexecve() as per cap_enter(2)
   man page;
 - syslog doesn't work at all - create special helper for it;
 - better privilege separation, now we simply create local/global
   daemons and grab spoolfd right at the beginning of the execution;
 - look for XXX:'s and TODO:'s in comments :-)
 - check if we can run dma-mbox-create as external helper;
 - evaluate needness for #ifdef's for CAPSICUM compilation;
 - hostname() in capability mode?
